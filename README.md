# CS F211 Data Structures and Algorithms (BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus)
This repository contains the problems, solution approaches & explanations and (for some problems) psueodocode or C code to solve the problem. In general, this repository will be updated with the latest labsheet around 5-7 days after the last lab evaluation on that labsheet is complete. Directories `a0, a1, ...` contain the solutions for the respective labsheets. A README/PDF file will be included in each of these, with the solution explanations for (atleast) some of the problems.

# Contribution Guidelines

When submitting a pull request please make sure your file name is in the format (Problem Number)_(Your name).c. Since we'll be getting many solutions for each problem, this helps us keep track of each one and also people know who's code it is when they look at it. Please make sure the Problem number is first so that all the codes for one question will be together in the repo (The repo keeps files in alphabetical order)

Ex: F_pranav_reddy.c or F_pranavreddy.c

Please make sure that your code passes all possible test cases to the best of your ability. Refrain from posting solutions that you know are wrong. Also make sure that you are putting the solution in the correct assignment folder to avoid future confusion. **We are currently accepting PRs for Assignments 1, 2 and 3 only**. If a certain question already has answers, please try to add another solution only if you believe your approach is significantly different/unique/more understandable.
